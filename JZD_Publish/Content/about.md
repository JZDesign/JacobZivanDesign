# Jacob Zivan Design

<br/>

Hey!

My name is Jacob. I'm a follower of Jesus, a father, and a nerd. About that nerd part—which this site is mostly focused on—I'm a staff software engineer who's passionate about the Swift and Kotlin languages. I've been fortunate enough to be mentored by some of the brightest and kindest people I've ever met. They are certainly a major part of why I've made it to where I'm at, and I'm very grateful.

I've been able to work on some great applications like:

- [Everydollar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/everydollar-personal-budget/id942571931) — _both iOS and Android before it was rewritten in Xamarin due to some C# fixated leaders_
- [Kroger](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/the-kroger-co/id403901189?see-all=i-phonei-pad-apps) — _technically all of their umbrella's mobile shopping apps_
- [Gazelle](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/gazelle) — A Fintech app that didn't last
- And others that are private enterprise apps

For any questions or feedback, you can email Help@JacobZivanDesign.com and I'll get back to you when I can.
